Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

```
The code is here
import abc.py
with open('abc', 'r') as fh:
	delete fh
```
The fucking machine is down

<div>
{% if page.comments %}
	<hr/>
	<h2>Comments</h2>
	<div class="fb-comments" data-href="{{ site.url }} {{ page.url }}" data-num-posts="4" data-width="706"></div>
{% endif %}
</div>
